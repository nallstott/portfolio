Welcome to the GitHub repo for my personal portfolio! Below is the list of in-progress tasks. The only external code I used for this site was lozad for lazy image handling and js-cookie because handling cookies in vanilla js is a nightmare.

In progress

TODO:
Site easter eggs

DETAILS:
Try to think of other little funny easter eggs to code in.

IDEAS:
Page(s) for content rankings from the about page for some of your interests. Scotch, fashion, anime, stand-up, magic: the gathering, dungeons and dragons.

8.)
TODO:
Refine iPad header styling

DETAILS:
iPadHeaderResizing.js has the code basically ready. Should be based on the device being identified, not just on screen height / width. Alternatively can be based on aspect ratio, but it would be better to have a catch-all for all apple tablet devices. Fuck the other shit.
